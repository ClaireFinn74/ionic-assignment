# My project Overview
My application is a simple information application.
It shows you 5 pages, you use the 'go to next suggestion' button to navigate these pages.
I have included 5 'Everyday Student Menus' showwing the amount of empty kilocalories we can consume without realising it.
I have then included 5 'Healthy Alternatives' to rectify this and to show you the amount of calories you can consume healthily instead to reach the RDA.
There is a scrolling function, coloured headings, a coloured header with an Icon and coloured 'buttons' to show the calories for each food.

##What this app is hoping to achieve:
This app will make students 'think twice' about the amount of calories they are consuming day to day and it will allow them to swap these unhealthy foods for things that can make a huge difference to their lifestyle.
A lot of students do not know the harm they are doing to their bodies with their busy lifestyle and I think it is important to be aware that you need the RDA or Reccommended Daily Allowance of calories to survive and be a healthy weight.
This app aims to make students aware of the foods you should be eating day to day to keep their busy bodies going and functioning well.
